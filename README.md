`llama3-cake` is a pure Rust implementation of the llama3 LLM distributed inference based on [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle).

**This is experimental code**.

The idea is to shard the transformer blocks to multiple devices in order to be able to run the inference on models that wouldn't normally fit in the GPU memory of a single device. Inferences over contiguous transformer blocks on the same worker are batched in order to minimize latency due to data transfer.

Run a worker node:

```bash
cake-cli --model /path/to/Meta-Llama-3-8B --mode worker --name worker0 --topology topology.yml --address 0.0.0.0:10128
```

Run a master node:

```bash
cake-cli --model /path/to/Meta-Llama-3-8B --topology topology.yml
```

Where `topology.yaml` determines which layers are served by whom:

```yaml
worker0:
  host: 'linux-server.local:10128'
  description: 'NVIDIA Titan X Pascal (12GB)'
  layers:
    - 'model.layers.0-15'

worker1:
  host: 'apple-server.local:10128'
  description: 'Apple M1 Max (64GB)'
  layers:
    - 'model.layers.16-31'
```

As a memory and disk space optimization, you might want to give the worker only the data it actually needs from the model instead of the whole folder, in which case you can use the `cake-split-model` utility. For instance to generate a smaller version of the llama3 safetensors, you can:

```bash
cake-split-model --model-path path/to/Meta-Llama-3-8B --topology path/to/topology.yml --output output-folder-name
```

This will create a smaller folder with only the required layers tensors and the topology file for the specific worker.
